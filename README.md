## Battle of Neighborhoods 
#### Finding the best Neighbourhood in Toronto using Data Science

Moving to new neighborhoods is not a trivial task. You do not know what it offers once you move in and actually live there and how your life will change. Data science can help us in 
quickly analysing the different places which can not be done manually considering there are so many factors to consider and there is so much data there that can not be manually processed.
Here we analyze neighborhoods of North York in Toronto, Canada. Data is collected from foursquare API. We get the nearby venues and analyse based on average housing prices and schools rating.
